## 10.06.2021

+ added the "work" page. This page displays a sort of timeline of my professional experiences.
+ try preloading some fonts again, as lighthouse wanted me to do it lol. This is never gonna end, is it?
+ all kinds of smaller color-contrast corrections to make the website more accessible

## 09.06.2021

+ improved font-loading, by utilising a service-worker `sw.js`, with help from [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com/improving-web-font-performance-with-service-workers/).
+ some files were renamed to be a bit more consistent and self-documenting.
+ implement a page for listing the 10 most recent blog posts and an archive list, that lists all posts.
+ add some new filters to eleventy: `console` in order to debug collections (as the `dump` filter seems to not work for this), `dateReadable`, to format the blog post dates to a readable date.
+ tweak how the headlines' URL fragments are displayed.
+ add the `eleventy-plugin-nesting-toc` by [Jordan Shurmer](https://github.com/JordanShurmer/eleventy-plugin-nesting-toc) plugin to automatically generate table of contents
+ allow the table of contents to [highlight whatever current headlined section is in view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXPtcbR1x0) which... kinda works. This needs some tweaking in the future. 
+ add a new template for blog post single views.
+ add some global `meta` data to make this easier accessible throughout the website.
+ add an [h-card](https://indieweb.org/h-card).
+ all kinds of minor and bigger changes to the CSS.

## First Version Priorities

Here is a bit of a summary of the things that were important to me for the initial, first version of the site:

+ All markdown-rendered headlines have anchor links. They are being generated by the markdown-it-anchor plugin - enhanced with [code from Nicolas Hoizey](https://nicolas-hoizey.com/articles/2021/02/25/accessible-anchor-links-with-markdown-it-and-eleventy/), based on suggestions [researched by Amber Wilson](https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/are-your-anchor-links-accessible/).
+ I wanted to _reduce_ **JavaScript** as much as possible use it only to progresively enhance. So the `:target`-selector in combination with url-fragments is being utilized to show the mobile flyout-menu and the color-settings on larger screens. I have not made this before - if you discover an issue, please let me know!
+ Providing a skip-to-content link. While researching on what [knowledgable people](https://kittygiraudel.com/2020/12/06/a11y-advent-skip-to-content/) that I look up to have to say about this topic, I also remembered reading that one of the WCAG suggested techniques for the corresponding success criteria ([2.4.1, Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks.html)) suggested adding links to multiple parts of the website. I never had the opportunity to implement that, so now was the time. I'm curious to find out if there is any response to this.
+ Get it out as _quickly_ as possible. I new that I didn't want to wait until I had all the content and design for everything done. I just wanted to be a little bit ahead with it, so that I could pick up development work whenever. But I also needed it to find a new job, so I decided that it needs to go live with the two pages most important for that (Hiring & About) and the imprint.
